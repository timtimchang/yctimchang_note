### ABSTRACT
- DocTr consists of a **geometric unwarping transformer** and an **illumination correction transformer**. 
- By setting a set of **learned query embedding**, the geometric unwarping transformer captures the global context of the document image by self-attention mechanism and decodes the pixel-wise displacement solution to correct the geometric distortion. 
- After geometric unwarping, our illumination correction transformer further **removes the shading artifacts** to improve the visual quality and OCR accuracy.

### APPROACH

> Figure 2: An overview of Document Image Transformer (DocTr). It consists of two main components: a geometric unwarping transformer and an illumination correction transformer.
#### Geometric Unwarping Transformer
- As shown in Figure 2, given an image $𝑰_{𝐷} ∈ R^{𝐻×𝑊 ×3}$ , we first downsample it and get the image $𝑰_{𝑑}∈ R^{𝐻+{0}×𝑊_{0}×𝐶_{0}}$ , where $𝐻_{0} = 𝑊_{0} = 288$ in our method and $𝐶_{0} = 3$ is the number of RGB channels.
- Then, $𝑰_{𝑑}$ is fed into the preprocessing module to get the background-excluded image $𝑰_{𝑒}$ which is injected into geometric unwarping transformer to predict a backward mapping field $𝒇_{𝑏}$.
- With $𝒇_{𝐵}$, the rectified document image $𝑰_{𝑅} ∈ R^{𝐻×𝑊 ×3}$ can be obtained by warping operation.

**Preprocessing**
- a **light semantic segmentation network** is utilized to predict the confidence map of the foreground document, which is further binarized with a threshold $\tau$ to obtain the binary document region mask $𝑴_{𝑰_{d}}$.


**Transformer Encoder**

- features are then extracted from $𝑰_{\theta}$ using a convolutional module $𝐺_{\theta}$ that consists of 6 residual blocks.

- $G_{\theta}$ downsamples the feature maps at $\frac{1}{2}$ resolution every two blocks and output features $𝑓_{g}$.

- we flatten $𝒇_{𝑔}$ into a sequence of 2D features, i.e., $𝒇_{𝑠} ∈ R^{𝑁_{𝑔}×𝑐_{𝑔}}$ , where $𝑁_{𝑔} = \frac{𝐻_{0}}{8} × \frac{𝑊_{0}}{8}$ is the number of patches.

- to maintain the position information in the process, we add learnable 2D position embedding $𝑬_{𝑝} ∈ R^{𝑁_{𝑔}×𝑐_{𝑔}}$ following, which is consistent to different input images.

- As shown in Fig 4, we train a learnable module to perform upsampling on the decoded features and obtain high-resolution predictions.

**Loss Function**
- The training loss for our geometric unwarping transformer is defined as the $𝐿_{1}$ distance between the predicted backward mapping $𝒇_{𝑏}$ and ground truth $𝒇_{𝑔𝑡}$ as follows,

#### Illumination Correction Transformer
- As shown in Figure 2, given the unwarped image 𝑰𝑅 ∈ R 𝐻×𝑊 ×3 , we first crop 𝑰𝑅 into patches with a overlap of 12.5% (each patch at 128×128 resolution).

**Transformer Encoder-Decoder**
- Like Transformer in Geometric Unwarping, reshape the patch feature $𝒇_{𝑖|}$ into a sequence of flattened 𝑃 × 𝑃 mini-patches.
- $f_{𝑠𝑝} ∈ R^{𝑁_{𝑖}×𝑐^{′}_{𝑖}}$ , where $𝑁_{𝑖} = \frac{𝐻_{𝑝}×𝑊_{𝑝}}{𝑝^{2}}$ is the number of mini-patches on the input image patch, $𝑐^{′}_{𝑖} = 𝑐_{𝑖} × 𝑃^{2}$ is the number of channels of transformer input. 
- Note that in our method, $𝑐_{𝑖}$ is set to 16, and $𝑃$ is set to 4.

**Loss Function**
We optimize the illumination correction transformer by minimizing the $𝐿_{1}$ distance and the VGG loss between the estimated patch image $𝐼_{𝑝}$ and ground truth image $𝐼_{𝑔𝑡}$ as follows,

where $\alpha$ is the weight of the VGG loss and $𝑉 (·)$ denotes the VGG Network.

### DATASET
- We train the geometric unwarping transformer on Doc3D dataset, following DewrapNet.
- our illumination correction transformer is optimized using the DRIC dataset.
- We evaluate the performance of our DocTr on Doc3D, DRIC, and DocUNet benchmark
